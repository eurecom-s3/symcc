This directory contains Ada bindings for the SymCC runtime. To use them in your
Ada code, you can either point gprbuild here directly (e.g., by setting
GPR_PROJECT_PATH appropriately), or you can install them in the system:

$ gprbuild -Psymcc
$ gprinstall -Psymcc

Either way, you'll then be able to include SymCC in your project definition
(i.e., the .gpr file for your project):

  with "symcc";

This will let you use the bindings in your Ada code, for example:

  with SymCC; use SymCC;

  --  ...

  --  Register a procedure that receives new program inputs.
  SymCC_Set_Test_Case_Handler (My_Handler);

  --  Tell SymCC where to find the input in memory. Note that the variable needs
  --  to be declared with the "aliased" keyword.
  SymCC_Make_Symbolic (Input'Address, Input'Size / System.Storage_Unit);

  --  Run your code on the input; SymCC will follow the computations
  --  symbolically and call My_Handler whenever it produces a new test input.
  My_Code_Under_Test (Input);

See the doc comments in symcc.ads for details, or generate HTML documentation
with "gnatdoc -Psymcc".
