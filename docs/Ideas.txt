Here we collect ideas around improvements and new features that could be
interesting to implement.


                       Position in the optimizer pipeline

Intuitively, we should run towards the end of the pipeline, so that the target
program has been simplified as much as possible. However, SymCC currently runs
just before the vectorizer - a position later in the pipeline would require
supporting LLVM vector instructions, so for now we choose implementation
simplicity over potential performance gains. Still, it would be very interesting
to check whether moving to the end of the pipeline accelerates the system
significantly, and how much it would cost in terms of complexity.


                             Optimize injected code

We should schedule a few optimization passes after inserting our
instrumentation, so that the instrumentation code gets optimized as well. This
becomes more important the further we move our pass to the end of the pipeline.
We could take inspiration from popular sanitizers like ASan and MSan regarding
the concrete passes to run, and their order. Also, we should enable link-time
optimization to inline some simple run-time support functions.


                      Free symbolic expressions in memory

SymCC currently doesn't free symbolic expressions. This is fine most of the time
because intermediate values are rarely computed without being used: typically,
they end up being inputs to future computations, so we couldn't free the
corresponding expressions anyway. A notable exception is the computation of
values only for output - the expressions for such values could be freed after
the value is output, which would reduce memory consumption especially with
output-heavy target programs.


                           Better fuzzer integration

Our current coordination with the fuzzer is very crude: we use AFL's distributed
mode to make it periodically pull new inputs from SymCC, and we try to
prioritize the most interesting inputs from AFL's queue for execution in SymCC.
However, a better integration would consider the trade-offs of symbolic
execution: it's expensive but uses more sophisticated reasoning. As long as the
fuzzer makes good progress (for some progress metric), CPU power should be
allocated only to the fuzzer; the price of symbolic execution should be paid
only when necessary. Moreover, a faster synchronization mechanism than AFL's
file-system based approach would be nice.


                            Work with other fuzzers

Integrating with AFL is easy because its distributed mode only requires working
with files and directories. Other fuzzers might not provide such easy
mechanisms, but by integrating with them we would gain whatever performance
improvements they have made over AFL (e.g., AFL++ or Honggfuzz).


                                Forking version

Instead of working with a fuzzer, we could also implement forking and some
scheduling strategy ourselves. Georgia Tech has developed some OS-level
primitives that could help to implement such a feature:
