Here we document how to reproduce the experiments that we show in the paper
"Symbolic execution with SymCC: Don't interpret, compile!" The same instructions
are available on our website [1], which also provides our raw results. Feel free
to reach out to us if you encounter problems with reproducing the benchmarks.

In the paper, we describe two sets of experiments: we first benchmark SymCC on
the CGC programs, then we run it on real-world software.


                                CGC experiments

We used the Linux port of the CGC programs by Trail of Bits [2]. SymCC needs to
be built with support for 32-bit compilation (see docs/32-bit.txt; this is not
part of the Dockerfile because it would double the build time of the container
while providing value to just a few users). Then you can simply export
CC=/path/to/symcc, CXX=/path/to/sym++ and SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1, and build
the CGC programs as usual (i.e., by invoking their build.sh script).

Run the programs on the raw PoV inputs [3] with SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1 to
measure pure execution time, and unset the environment variable for symbolic
execution. To assess coverage, we ran afl-showmap with the AFL-instrumented CGC
programs on each generated input and accumulated the resulting coverage maps per
program, resulting in a set of covered map entries for each CGC program. The
sizes of those sets can then be fed to the scoring formula presented in the
paper.

For KLEE and QSYM, we used the setup described in our IR study [3] but with the
regular 32-bit binaries built by cb-multios.


                              Real-world software

The analysis of real-world software always follows the same procedure. Assuming
you have exported CC=symcc, CXX=sym++ and SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1, first
download the code, then build it using its own build system, finally unset
SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT and analyze the program in concert with AFL (which
requires building a second time for AFL, see docs/Fuzzing.txt). We used AFL
2.56b and built the targets with AFL_USE_ASAN=1. Note that the fuzzing helper is
already installed in the Docker container.

OpenJPEG [4]: we used revision 1f1e9682, built with CMake as described in the
  project's INSTALL.md (adding "-DBUILD_THIRDPARTY=ON" to make sure that
  third-party libraries are compiled with SymCC as well), and analyzed
  "bin/opj_decompress -i @@ -o /tmp/image.pgm"; the corpus consisted of test
  files file1.jp2 and file8.jp2 [5].

libarchive [6]: we used revision 9ebb2484, built with CMake as described in the
  poject's INSTALL (but adding "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release"), and analyzed
  "bin/bsdtar tf @@"; the corpus consisted of just a single dummy file
  containing the character "A".

tcpdump: we built both tcpdump [7] and libpcap [8]; in order to make the former
  find the latter, just place the source directories next to each other in the
  same folder. We used revision d615abec of libpcap and revision d57927e1 of
  tcpdump. We built first libpcap and then tcpdump with "./configure && make",
  and analyzed "tcpdump/tcpdump -e -r @@"; the corpus consisted of just a single
  dummy file containing the character "A".

All experiments used one AFL master process, one secondary AFL process, and one
SymCC process. We let them run for 24 hours and repeated each of them 30 times
to create the graphs in the paper; AFL map density was extracted from the
secondary AFL process' "plot_data" file, column "map_size".

The QSYM experiments used an analogous setup, replacing SymCC with QSYM and
running it with AFL according to the QSYM authors' instructions [9].
